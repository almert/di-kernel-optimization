# DI Kernel Optimization
### Python codes for optimizing kernel mappings based on the Discriminant Information criterion

## Overview
This project contains the Python codes for optimizing Nystrom and Random Fourier feature maps based on the Discriminant Information (DI) criterion. The codes were used to perform the experiments reported in [[1](#citation)] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10432).
